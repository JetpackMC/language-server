# Contributing to Jetpack Language Support

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Jetpack Language Support. This document describes the basic collaboration guidelines for contributing to the project.

Jetpack Language Support is a TypeScript-based VS Code extension and language server for Jetpack `.jet` scripts. Changes can affect diagnostics, completion, navigation, rename behavior, semantic highlighting, or VSIX packaging, so please clearly share the intent of your change and how you verified it.

## General Principles

- Keep changes as small and clear as possible.
- Keep each PR focused on a single purpose.
- If behavior changes, explain the reason and impact in the PR.
- Do not hide failures. When handling errors, provide context that helps users understand what happened.
- Do not commit sensitive information, personal tokens, local editor state, or generated build artifacts.

## Branch Strategy

The default target branch for PRs is `develop`.

- `main`: Stable branch. Only releases or stabilized changes should be merged here.
- `develop`: Integration branch. General features, bug fixes, and refactoring PRs should target this branch.
- Working branches: We recommend creating them from `develop`.

For urgent release or packaging issues, you may use a `hotfix/` branch. In that case, please explain in the PR description why the regular `develop` flow is not being used.

## Branch Naming Guidelines

Branch names should make the type and purpose of the change clear.

| Prefix | Purpose |
| :-: | :-- |
| `features/` | New features |
| `bugs/` | Bug fixes |
| `refactor/` | Structural improvements that do not intentionally change behavior |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent and critical fixes |
| `chore/` | Build, documentation, configuration, and maintenance tasks |
| `agents/` | Mostly AI-agent-driven contributions. Please use the `agents/Prefix/...` format. |

Branch naming rules:

- Use lowercase letters and hyphens.
- Clearly describe the target area or problem being addressed.
- If most of the work came from an AI Agent, please use `agents/Prefix/...`, where `Prefix` matches the change category. For example: `features`, `bugs`, `refactor`, `hotfix`, or `chore`.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should briefly and clearly describe the nature of the change. This repository currently uses the following style.

Recommended prefixes:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation change
- `refactor`: Structural change without behavior changes
- `chore`: Build, configuration, or maintenance task

Keep commits in reviewable units, but avoid leaving excessive intermediate work-in-progress commits.

## Pull Request

PRs should target the `develop` branch by default.

The PR title should describe the main change. The PR description should include:

- Purpose of the change
- Main changes made
- Impact on extension users or script authors
- Commands used for verification
- Related issue numbers, if any, using `Closes #123` or `Fixes #123`
- Tool and model used, if you used an AI Agent

If there are behavior changes, compatibility impacts, or migration requirements, please call them out separately.

## Code Change Guidelines

Jetpack Language Support combines a VS Code extension with a language server for the Jetpack scripting language. Please follow these guidelines when making changes.

- Keep lexer, parser, resolver, checker, and symbol index changes as small and focused as possible.
- Keep language-server behavior consistent with the Jetpack runtime where applicable.
- Diagnostics should be reported in a way that script authors can understand.
- Do not simply swallow exceptions. Hidden failures make editor behavior and packaging issues difficult to trace.
- If a setting, package field, command, or LSP capability changes public behavior, explain the compatibility impact in the PR.
- If you need to modify a generated file, also check the source and process used to generate it.

## AI Agent Usage

We welcome AI-assisted contributions. Jetpack believes AI Agents can be useful tools for quickly exploring good ideas and refining implementations.

If you used an AI Agent, please add a short note in the PR message `Additional Notes`. If possible, include the tool and model you used. We would also love to know which tools and models were genuinely helpful or impressive.
